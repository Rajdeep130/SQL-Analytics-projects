# ðŸ›’ Retail Business Sales Analysis Project

# ðŸ“– Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a Retail Sales Database containing customers, products, and sales data using SQL. The goal is to perform data exploration, business metrics calculation, segmentation, and ranking analysis to derive actionable business insights.

### The analysis covers:

- Data Exploration (Tables, Columns, and Dimensions)
- Customer Demographics and Segmentation
- Product Category Insights
- Sales Trends (First and Last Order Dates)
- Key Business Metrics (Revenue, Orders, Products, Customers)
- Magnitude Analysis (By Country, Gender, Category)
- Ranking Analysis (Top/Bottom Products and Customers)
- Pre-built SQL report generation with UNION ALL
- The results of this project will help businesses understand customer behavior, product performance, and revenue generation trends.

## ðŸš€ SQL Queries & Analysis
Describe the key SQL operations performed:
## 1. Data Exploration : 
**Explore All Objects in the Database**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
   ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6683e233-2079-4b49-a67b-6407c26b6a84)

**Explore All columns in the Database**
   ```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'gold.dim_customers'
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90174b98-47db-4e09-b9d8-fc6e3c4449b5)

## 2. Dimension Exploration:

**Explore All Countries our Customers come from.**
   ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country

**All the product categories "The Major Division".**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM
	[gold.dim_products];

SELECT DISTINCT category,subcategory
FROM
	[gold.dim_products];

SELECT DISTINCT category,subcategory, product_name

 **A high_level overview insights that hleps with strategic decision-making.**

 ```sql

MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
sum(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity 
from [gold.fact_sales]
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY MONTH(order_date) DESC
 ```
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb8c0e87-f217-48f0-a8b0-656e92b19ba8)

 ```sql
 SELECT 
DATETRUNC(month, order_date) AS order_month,
sum(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity 
from [gold.fact_sales]
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, order_date)
ORDER BY DATETRUNC(month, order_date)
 ```
-- one thing you will notice here that output will have sorted date here 
-- beacuse output is Date not string.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d735b10-c2a5-4b50-8286-d21d23aa6503)

 ```sql
SELECT
FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MMM') AS order_date,
SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM [gold.fact_sales]
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY FORMAT(order_date,'yyyy-MMM')
ORDER BY FORMAT(order_date,'yyyy-MMM');
 ```
-- If you look into the output you will found result is 
-- not sorted accounding to order date 
-- beacuse order_date is in string format

## Cumulative Analysis
**Purpose:**

    - To calculate running totals or moving averages for key metrics.
    - To track performance over time cumulatively.
    - Useful for growth analysis or identifying long-term trends.

**Calculate the total sales per month and the running total of sales over time.**
 ```sql
-- First Create subquery like this then go for cumulative total

SELECT 
DATETRUNC(month, order_date) AS order_date,
SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM [gold.fact_sales]
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, order_date)
ORDER BY DATETRUNC(month, order_date)
 ```
 ```sql

SELECT 
order_date,
total_sales,
SUM(total_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY order_date ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total_sales
FROM 
(SELECT 
DATETRUNC(month, order_date) AS order_date,
SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM [gold.fact_sales]
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, order_date)
)t
 ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4b102f5-788f-4aee-ae24-e7b7e1afd24c)


**If you want to look for moving Avg also**
 ```sql
SELECT 
order_date,
total_sales,
SUM(total_sales) OVER(ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total_sales,
AVG(avg_price) OVER(ORDER BY order_date) AS moving_average_price
FROM 
(SELECT 
DATETRUNC(YEAR, order_date) AS order_date,
SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM [gold.fact_sales]
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATETRUNC(YEAR, order_date)
)t
 ```

## Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
**Purpose:**

    - To measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time.
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track yearly trends and growth.

**SQL Functions Used:**

    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.

** Analyze the yearly performance of products by comparing their sales 
to both the average sales performance of the product and the previous year's sales**

-- Year over Year Analysis
 ```sql

	YEAR(f.order_date) AS order_year,
