## üìÉGenerate a Report that shows all key metrics of the business
   ```sql
SELECT 'Total Sales' AS measure_name, SUM(sales_amount) AS measure_value FROM [gold.fact_sales]
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Quantity' AS measure_name, SUM(quantity) AS measure_value FROM [gold.fact_sales]
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Avg Selling Price' AS measure_name, AVG(price) AS measure_value FROM [gold.fact_sales]
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Orders' AS measure_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_number) AS measure_value FROM [gold.fact_sales]
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Products' AS measure_name, COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) AS measure_value FROM [gold.dim_products]
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Customers' AS measure_name, COUNT(customer_key) AS measure_value FROM [gold.dim_customers]
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Active Customers' AS measure_name, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS measure_value FROM [gold.fact_sales];
   ```

**to Create a Report like this  using CHART GPT then write this PROMPT: 
Create a SQL report using a UNION ALL format, where each measure
has a descriptive name in the measure_name column and its calculated 
value in the measure_value column.**
